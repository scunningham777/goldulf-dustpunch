Ooh! Ah! Clean up those dungeons! No one's been through these archaeological sites in years, so there's plenty of detritus to keep you busy. The more cobwebs you punch, the more points you earn. Oof!

## Roadmap
Expect the following updates at some point in your lifetime. Note the order here does not necessarily reflect the order in which these will be completed. 
1. Music. 
2. Ability to restart the game, though I don't know why you'd want to. 
3. 4 total Site types (not including the overworld), each with its own color scheme, tileset, and set of Stuff to find. 
4. A custom Ancestor Spirit type for each Site type, which will be encountered less frequently than the basic kind. 
5. Relics to be acquired from the special Ancestor Spirit types mentioned above. 
6. Randomized messages from Ancestor Spirits. 
7. Special variations of the Site types, unlocked by acquiring special combinations of Relics. 
8. Special variations of the Ancestor Spitits, found in yhe Special Sute types, and handing out Artifacts!
9. And nicer-looking menus

## Development Terminology
1. Player: person playing the game.
2. Hero: the in-game character controlled by the Player.
3. Site: a section of the overworld that the Hero traverses between archaeological site cleanups, or one of said archaeological sites. Can be multiple levels.
4. Level: a single map section of a Site. Some Sites can be a single Level, but many are made up of multiple Levels.
